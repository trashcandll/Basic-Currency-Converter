# Basic-Currency-Converter
This is a basic beginners currency converter using forex_python curreny converter module. 
I have used the forex_python converter to convert the currencies.
This is done only using basic variables and print function. This definitely contains some bugs but is great for a quick beginner project to get some projects going. I will soon release a debugged version with GUI to interect with.
Thank you and have fun
